Badar (group-manager):
I did the Focus on Your Business site, creating the nav bar and the body of the page (minus the header and footer which Julia and beck completed respectively). I used bootstrap primarily to construct my code and added usable links and different bootstrap features such as modals and drop down bars to make my site more functional. I was also the project manager of our group, where I created the main repository for our website and approved or denied pull requests and commit changes to the final project.

Julia:
I worked mostly on the index.html file. I used mostly bootstrap with some flex-box. The sections I created were the "Focus on your business" section, the "start to Explore Double Tap" section, and the "solutions to fit your business needs." Badar created the nav bar and the "start accepting payments" box. Beck made the footer. I mostly used bootstrap grids with some flexbox. I challenged myself to make as many of the shapes and elements as I could with CSS, including the image of the shapes with rounded corners. 

Beck:
I did sign-in-beck.html, sign-in-beck.css, and the footer for the landing and how-to pages

Jason:
My part of the project was the Sign Up page.  I used a YouTube video to create this Sign Up page using HTML, CSS, bootstrap, an visual studio code.
